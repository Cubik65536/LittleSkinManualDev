## Timeliness description

Emails aren't instant messaging. Although Emails are higher efficiency than instant messaging, but its workloads are much bigger, processing speed are much slower. All emails will reply in three days to one week, but we won't reply emails that we think it's unnecessary to reply.

After sending email, please be patient with waiting for reply. If you don't receive any reply for a long time, you can send one more email to ask. But please don't send emails frequently to urge in a short time, or your Email address will be pull black.

If you need high timeliness technical support, please join our [Official User Group](/user-group.html) for help, instead of sending Email Ticket.
