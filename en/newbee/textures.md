# Set the textures

After you create your player, you can apply the textures to your player.

You can upload your textures or just add textures from the Skin Library to your Closet.

## Upload your textures

If you have your file for the texture, you can upload it to the Skin Library. Only the textures in the Skin Library could be added to the closet.

LittleSkin supports single-layer skin (size 64\*32 or its integer multiple), double layer skin (size 64\*64 or its integer multiple) and 64\*32 capes (22\*17 capes are not supported), the texture of the elytra should be drawn directly on the cape. All the textures should be png format images.

::: tip
You will have to pay some scores to upload the textures, it will be counted regarding the size of your texture file. When your texture has been added by someone else, you will get scores rewards.

For public textures, every KB of storage will cost you 1 score. And for private textures, every KB of storage will cost you 20 scores. The score will be paid back when you delete the texture.

Every public texture can collect 10 scores while someone adds it to their closet. It will be removed when they delete it from their closet.
