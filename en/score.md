The scores system is an important mechanism of LittleSkin, which is equivalent to the currency system in reality.

You need to consume certain scores when you upload or add textures in LittleSkin or participate in some site activities; you can earn scores by signing in and participating in site activities.

## When you consume scores.

### Uploading textures 
Upload textures will cost you some scores.

For public textures, every KB of storage will cost you 1 score. And for private textures, every KB of storage will cost you 20 scores.

::: warning
The estimated score consumption displayed on the uploading page is for reference only, and the actual score consumption will be calculated based on the actual size of the texture file.

### Add textures to closet

Add a texture to the closet will cost you 10 scores, and it will be paid back when you delete it.

### Report a texture

To prevent malicious reports, when reporting textures, 100 scores will be removed as a mortgage.

If the texture is illegal, these scores will be paid back to you, and you will also get score rewards. Otherwise, it will not be paid back.

### Make a public texture private.

If you make your public texture private, then the scores needed for private texture will be removed.

##  Getting scores

### Initial points for new users

Every new user will get 1000 scores.

Every day, by clicking the「Sign」button in the user center, you can get points ranging from 10 to 100 randomly. You can only sign in once a day, and the sign-in opportunities on the day will not accumulate to the next day. The sign-in points rewards may be temporarily adjusted during site activities.

### Public textures have been added by someone else

When the public textures that you uploaded have been added to the closet of someone else, you will get 10 scores.
