# How to report a problem

Nothing is perfect, nor LittleSkin.

If you have any problem while you use LittleSkin (including but not limited to: textures that aren't showing, bugs on the website, etc.), don't utterly discomfited， please fully understand the following content, and then ask the question correctly.

## The first reaction while having a problem

> DON'T PANIC.

Firstly, you should check if this is your problem at first. For most of the time, LittleSkin can run normally. If you get an error, please make sure that this isn't your problem at first: Network error, wrong operation, even your browser's error can make you run into a problem while using LittleSkin. So, before asking questions, please judge with your experience, this is your problem or not.

Secondly, you should read [FAQ](/faq.html). Sometimes, your problem might trouble many other people, and these problems have already a solution. In this situation, read the FAQ directly can solve your problem quickly.

If you're sure that it's not your problem, and your problem isn't in the FAQ, you can prepare to report the problem.

## Operating staffs aren't god

It seems to me most of you don't know it.

Then let us tell you the truth:

> The operating team cannot recognize the problem with just a few words!

So, when you report the problem, don't just say "Server has a problem." or "The skin is not loading." and then leave. It's **impossible** for us to know what happened to you if we don't have the support of the information like the log or screenshot.

## What should I provide?

It might change in a different situation. But here's some general information to provide:

### Screenshot of the error

With LittleSkin's website, while there's an error, the website will show related information. Please take a screenshot of the information or the whole web page, and provide it while reporting the error.

### Steps to Reproduce

Many of those problems will only happen with some exact operation. Providing the steps to reproduce can let the site admin know how this problem happened, and recognize and solve the problem quickly.

### Logs

All sorts of logs are mandatory to recognize the errors. So if you have these logs, provide them while reporting the error:

- If the skin is not showing in the game, provide the log for the skin loader Mod:
    - CustomSkinLoader's log in under `.minecraft/CustomSkinLoader/CustomSkinLoader.log`
- If it's Yggdrasil's problem, reproduce the problem with JVM argument `-Dauthlibinjector.debug=all` added and provide these logs:
    - Every log generated by the server from its startup till there's the error (the latest log generated by the server is under `logs/latest.log`).
    - Every log generated by the client from its startup till there's the error (the latest log generated by the server is under `.minecraft/logs/latest.log`).
        - If you have it, use in priority the log exported with the test function of the game launcher.
    - Log of the game launcher (please ask the launcher's creator for the location of the log file)

If you don't have these logs, please tell them while asking the question; if you've been asked for more information, please provide that information to help us find the problem.
